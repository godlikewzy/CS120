    <h1>Zhenyi Wu</h1>
    <p>Last summer, I traveled to Acadia National Park with my friends. We chose a challenging trail and climbed to the top of Cadillac Mountain.
    During the climb, it started raining heavily, making the hike even more difficult. At one point, we had to use both hands and feet to make sure we won't roll down the hill.
    Despite the hardships, when we reached the summit and looked at the stunning view around us, it was all worth it!</p>
    
    <h2>My Favorite Pets</h2>

        <li>A cat named "JiuJiu" - Tabby Cat</li>
        <li>A cat named "Coffee" - American Longhair</li>

    <h2>My Favorite Restaurant</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite places to eat is <a href="https://www.seibarwakefield.com/" target="_blank">Sei Bar</a>. It serves the most authentic Hunan cuisine,
    which is also the food from my hometown. Almost every dish they offer brings me the nostalgic taste of home.</p>

        My favorite food is stir-fried beef, especially when cooked with cilantro and chili. This dish is spicy and salty, making it the perfect companion for rice.
        After finishing the beef, I love pouring the remaining sauce over the rice. If you usually eat just one bowl of rice, trust me, with this dish,
        you might finish three bowls and still crave more!
